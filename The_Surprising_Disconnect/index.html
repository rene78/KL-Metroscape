    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This article aims to investigate the factors contributing to the underwhelming ridership of Kuala Lumpur's Mass
      Rapid Transport (MRT) system. The primary issues identified include insufficient first/last-mile connectivity
      and a notable absence of infrastructure supporting pedestrian and human-powered modes of transportation. In this
      context, the article not only presents overarching concepts for improving the public transportation system, but
      also provides specific and cost-effective recommendations for the MRT Putrajaya Line that could lead to a
      significant increase in ridership.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In 2010 it was decided by the Malaysian government to implement a state-of-the-art Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) for
      Kuala Lumpur to achieve the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Efficient Mobility:</b> Provide fast and efficient transportation, reducing the ever worsening traffic
        congestion problem in Klang Valley.</li>
      <li><b>Reduced Dependency on Cars:</b> Encourage a shift from private car usage, saving energy and reducing
        reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
      <li><b>Environmental Sustainability:</b> Promote eco-friendly transportation, reducing air pollution and
        greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
      <li><b>Economic Growth:</b> Attract investments, stimulate economic activity, and enhance property values along
        their routes.</li>
      <li><b>Increased inclusion:</b> Give more freedom to individuals with limited physical capabilities or financial
        resources.</li>
      <li><b>Quality of Life:</b> Improves overall quality of life by reducing stress, noise, congestion and pollution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As of 2023, two lines - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajang_line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Kajang Line</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya_line"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrajaya Line</a> - have been successfully constructed at a total
      cost of RM78 billion.<a href="#wiki-mrt1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt1-ref"></a><a
        href="#wiki-mrt2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt2-ref"></a>
      Furthermore, a third line - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRT_Circle_Line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle Line</a> - is currently in its planning phase with an additional investment of
      about <a href="#nst-mrt3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nst-mrt3-ref">RM45 billion.</a> This train network
      is considered the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in Malaysia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users of the new MRT system would unanimously attest to the world-class quality of its stations and trains, which
      easily rival those in cities like Seoul and Singapore. Moreover, care was taken to ensure that ticket prices are
      affordable for everyone. However, despite these favorable aspects, ridership falls considerably short of initial
      expectations. For instance, the Kajang line was originally projected to serve approximately <a
        href="#nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        id="nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer-ref">400,000 daily commuters.</a> Yet, since
      its inauguration in 2017, actual ridership has plateaued at roughly half of that figure.<a
        href="#myrapid-ridership-numbers" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="myrapid-ridership-numbers-ref"></a>
      Meanwhile, the average road user in Kuala Lumpur spends 75 hours each year stuck in traffic congestion.<a

    So why haven't Kuala Lumpur residents embraced the opulent and expensive new MRT lines, preferring instead to
    continue using their private vehicles?
    </p>

    <h2>Why Ridership Remains Low</h2>
    <p>In essence, there are two straightforward explanations for why numerous individuals opt to brave the daily
      traffic-congested journey to work in their personal vehicles:</p>
    <p class="paragraph-highlight">Insufficient Network Density</p>
    <p>Commuters seek convenience and proximity to their destinations. Addressing this fundamental challenge demands
      dedicated politicians who recognize the vital role of public transportation and prioritize its expansion.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-highlight">Inaccessible Stations</p>
    <p>This issue runs deeper and warrants further exploration: What factors contribute to the station's
      inaccessibility?</p>
    <h3>Unfavourable Station Locations</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>During the construction phase, cost-saving measures like the avoidance of extensive tunneling work often led to
      the placement of MRT stations along highways or in underdeveloped areas rather than in locations where people live
      and work. This has resulted in disappointingly low population density around the stations. Unfortunately, valuable
      land adjacent to the MRT stations is frequently underutilized, occupied by:</p>

      <li>Low-density gated communities with single-family homes (<a

    <p><span style="color: red;">Roads are main obstacles</span> Like many relatively young cities in Asia and
      Northamerica KL completely centered the urban development around
      the automobile. More and more highways are cutting and dividing established neighborhoods. Not surprisingly
      roads and highways are the main obstacles now for commuters on the way to the train station. It is not uncommon
      that an apartment complex with thousands of potential MRT users is separated by an insurmountable highway
      from the station.</p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Think about adding more subheadings</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Show and explain reach analysis of a rather bad station and compare it with something
        in another country (side-by-side pic)</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Neglected pedestrian infrastructure. Pedestrian infrastructure is in a bad state at
        best or altogether nonexistent at worst risking the lifes of
        people who dare to walk, anyway. Insert <a
          href="https://twitter.com/elisahanimm/status/1702679226128978033?t=0HkbF_--8-MGm4zB3IylpA&s=19">Twitter
          post</a> here.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">erratic cul-de-sac roads and gated communities not only lead to a centralized traffic
        flow but makes it also harder for commuters to walk or cycle to the stations.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Motor vehicle dependent transit: Commuters who need to use the car to reach the MRT
        stations overflowing "Park and Ride"
        lots will rather drive all the way to their destination. Feeder buses in its current form are unreliable, get
        stuck in traffic and have a low frequency.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Sometimes major issues, e.g. LRT line out of service for 1 year. Reduced amount of
        coaches lead to long waiting times in between departures, etc. (Twitter post about LRT breakdown?)</span></p>
