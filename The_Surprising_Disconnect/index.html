    <h1>1 Abstract</h1>
    <p>This article aims to investigate the factors contributing to the underwhelming ridership of Kuala Lumpur's Mass
      Rapid Transport (MRT) system. The primary issues identified include low population density around stations,
      insufficient first/last-mile connectivity and a notable absence of infrastructure supporting pedestrian and
      human-powered modes of transportation. In this context, the article not only presents overarching concepts for
      improving the public transportation system, but also provides specific and cost-effective recommendations for the
      MRT Putrajaya Line that could lead to a significant increase in ridership.</p>

    <h1>2 Introduction</h1>
    <p>In 2010 it was decided by the Malaysian government to implement a state-of-the-art Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) for
      Kuala Lumpur to achieve the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Efficient Mobility:</b> Provide fast and efficient transportation, reducing the ever worsening traffic
        congestion problem in Klang Valley.</li>
      <li><b>Reduced Dependency on Cars:</b> Encourage a shift from private car usage, saving energy and reducing
        reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
      <li><b>Environmental Sustainability:</b> Promote eco-friendly transportation, reducing air pollution and
        greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
      <li><b>Economic Growth:</b> Attract investments, stimulate economic activity, and enhance property values along
        their routes.</li>
      <li><b>Increased inclusion:</b> Give more freedom to individuals with limited physical capabilities or financial
        resources.</li>
      <li><b>Quality of Life:</b> Improves overall quality of life by reducing stress, noise, congestion and pollution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As of 2023, two lines - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajang_line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Kajang Line</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya_line"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrajaya Line</a> - have been successfully constructed at a total
      cost of RM78 billion.<a href="#wiki-mrt1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt1-ref"></a><a
        href="#wiki-mrt2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt2-ref"></a>
      Furthermore, a third line - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRT_Circle_Line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle Line</a> - is currently in its planning phase with an additional investment of
      about <a href="#nst-mrt3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nst-mrt3-ref">RM45 billion.</a> This train network
      is considered the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in Malaysia.

      Users of the new MRT system would unanimously attest to the world-class quality of its stations and trains, which
      easily rival those in cities like Seoul and Singapore. Moreover, care was taken to ensure that ticket prices are
      affordable for everyone. However, despite these favorable aspects, ridership falls considerably short of initial
      expectations. For instance, the Kajang line was originally projected to serve approximately <a
        href="#nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        id="nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer-ref">400,000 daily commuters.</a> Yet, since
      its inauguration in 2017, actual ridership has plateaued at roughly half of that figure.<a
        href="#myrapid-ridership-numbers" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="myrapid-ridership-numbers-ref"></a>
      Meanwhile, the average road user in Kuala Lumpur spends 75 hours each year stuck in traffic congestion.<a

    <p>
      So why haven't Kuala Lumpur residents embraced the opulent and expensive new MRT lines, preferring instead to
      continue using their private vehicles?
    </p>

    <h1>3 Why Ridership Remains Low</h1>
    <p>Essentially, there are three simple reasons why many people choose to endure the daily commute in their own cars
      despite the traffic congestion:</p>
    <h2>3.1 Insufficient Network Density</h2>
    <p>Commuters seek convenience and proximity to their destinations. Addressing this fundamental challenge demands
      dedicated politicians who recognize the vital role of public transportation and prioritize its expansion.</p>
    <h2>3.2 Inaccessible Stations</h2>
    <p>This issue runs deeper and warrants further exploration: What factors contribute to the station's
      inaccessibility?</p>

    <h3>3.2.1 Unfavourable Station Locations</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>During the construction phase, cost-saving measures like the avoidance of extensive tunneling work often led to
      the placement of MRT stations along highways or in underdeveloped areas rather than in locations where people live
      and work. This has resulted in disappointingly low population density around the stations. Unfortunately, valuable
      land adjacent to the MRT stations is frequently underutilized, occupied by:</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>3.2.2 Roads as Obstacles</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>Similar to numerous other young cities in Asia and North America, Kuala Lumpur has largely structured its urban
      development around automobile-centric infrastructure. This emphasis on car-centric planning has led to an
      ever increasing amount of highways that crisscross and dissect established neighborhoods within the city.
      Unsurprisingly, the pervasive road networks and expressways have emerged as the principal hurdles confronting
      daily commuters on their journey to reach the nearest train station. What is increasingly prevalent is the
      disheartening reality that apartment complexes, housing thousands of potential users of the Mass Rapid Transit
      (MRT) system, find themselves isolated by seemingly insurmountable highways, creating a stark physical and
      psychological divide between residents and the public transportation network.
    </p>

    <h3 id="private-neighborhoods-as-obstacles">3.2.3 Private Neighborhoods as Obstacles</h3>
    <figure class="figure-float-right">

          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStreetMap</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Gated communities and cordoned-off residential areas further worsen the accessibility of public transport stops.
      These closed-off places force pedestrians and cyclists to take a diversion on their way to the station - often
      along a busy road. In addition, gated communities frequently prevent cars from using the direct route to their
      destination. The private roads of the gated communities force the drivers to divert onto main roads, which further
      deteriorate the overall traffic situation.</p>
    <h3>3.2.4 Neglected Pedestrian Infrastructure</h3>
    <figure class="figure-float-right">

    </figure>
    <p>In Kuala Lumpur, the condition of pedestrian infrastructure leaves much to be desired, ranging from subpar to
      completely absent in some areas. This unfortunate reality places the lives of those who venture to walk to public
      transport stations at considerable risk. Navigating the city's streets on foot can be a perilous endeavor, with
      inadequate sidewalks, poorly marked crosswalks, and a lack of pedestrian-friendly amenities making the journey
      treacherous. Many drivers also assume that pedestrians will wait until they have driven by - even at zebra
      crossings
      and green pedestrian lights. As a result, many residents opt for the perceived safety and convenience of their own
      cars when commuting, further exacerbating the city's traffic congestion and environmental challenges.</p>

    <h3>3.2.5 Vehicle-dependent public transport</h3>
    <p>Public transit faces significant challenges in areas with low population density around its stations. Kuala
      Lumpur's MRT system is no exception, as it often requires commuters to rely on private vehicles, e-hailing
      services like Grab, or feeder buses to access the stations. However, each of these options presents its unique set
      of challenges.</p>
    <figure class="figure-float-right">

      <figcaption>Cars have to park on the street in front of the park-and-ride of Cyberjaya Utara MRT station -
        Source: Own work</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><b>Private Vehicle Dilemma:</b> Many commuters choose to use their private vehicles for the entire journey to
      their
      destinations rather than
    <ul>
      <li>navigating the traffic to reach the MRT station</li>
      <li>finding a parking spot at the regularly overflowing Park N' Ride facility</li>
      <li>the need to have another bus journey to reach their final destination</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>E-hailing Quandary:</b> E-hailing services like Grab offer an alternative way to reach MRT stations. However,
      this
      convenience comes at a cost that can offset the economic advantages of using public transport. Affordability
      remains a key issue for many commuters, especially in areas where public transit is intended to provide a more
      economical mode of transportation.</p>

          rel="noopener noreferrer">@NabilErsyad</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><b>Feeder Bus Challenges:</b> The feeder bus system, a crucial link between residential areas and MRT stations,
      faces a
      number of issues of its own. In its current form, the coverage area of feeder buses is often limited, leaving many
      potential passengers without convenient access. Moreover, the overall number of feeder buses is insufficient,
      leading to discomfort for those who do use them. These buses are frequently plagued by
      unreliability, making it difficult for passengers to plan their journeys with confidence. They often become
      ensnared in the same traffic jams that plague private vehicles, leading to unpredictable schedules and longer
      travel times. The low frequency of feeder bus services further compounds the problem, as passengers often must
      wait for extended periods without a reliable timetable to guide their travels.</p>

    <h2>3.3 Operational and Design Issues</h2>

          rel="noopener noreferrer">@NabilErsyad</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><b>Train Reliability and frequency:</b> The reduced number of trainsets has led to extended waiting times between
      departures, a significant drawback for MRT passengers. A 10-minute train frequency, while a step in the right
      direction, still falls short of the standards set by modern metro systems around the world. Additionally,
      prolonged service outages, some stretching up to a year, have been a cause for frustration and dissatisfaction
      among commuters.</p>
    <p><b>Communication Challenges:</b> Efficient communication during service interruptions is pivotal to providing a
      positive
      commuting experience. Regrettably, the MRT system in Kuala Lumpur often falls short in this regard, leaving
      passengers uninformed and dissatisfied.</p>
    <p><b>Maintenance Woes:</b> The infrastructure of MRT stations has also raised concerns. Issues such as ceilings
      with water
      leaks, broken escalators, elevators, and toilets create a less-than-ideal environment for passengers.</p>
    <p><b>Station size:</b> One notable point of contention among users of Kuala Lumpur's new MRT lines is the enormous
      size of
      the stations. Commuters often find themselves faced with long walks to reach the train platforms, which can be a
      source of frustration and inconvenience.</p>

    </figure>
    <p><b>Boost Population Density Near Stations:</b> Construct high-density, affordable condominiums around transit
      stations to increase ridership. One mid-sized condo leads to more MRT users than a huge park-and-ride lot at the
      same location. Rededicate land near MRT stations wherever necessary, e.g. by relocating police
      stations. Focus on developing condos and pedestrian friendly neighborhoods at yet undeveloped stations,
      such as Bandar Malaysia. Ensure affordability as a key criterion for these developments. Reconsider whether the
      first 6-10 floors of these apartment blocks really need to be used as car park.</p>

    </figure>
    <p><b>Pedestrian and Cyclist-Friendly Infrastructure:</b> Prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety by providing wide
      sidewalks, ground-level pedestrian crossings and bike lanes which are separated from traffic. Make sure that the
      public space can be accessed by wheelchair users. Sidewalks and bike paths should have ramps and curb cuts for
      easy access. Create more connecting pathways between neighbourhoods and stations, as described in the following
      chapter using the Putrajaya Line as an example. During construction work, ensure safe rerouting of footpaths and
      proper traffic control.</p>
    <p><b>Prevent the spread of gated communities:</b> They often impede traffic flow and obstruct the direct routes
      for pedestrians and cyclists to reach their destinations. Many Malaysians are rightfully concerned about home
      security<a href="#theleaders-what-explains-the-steep-drop-in-reports-of-break-ins-and-thefts-in-malaysia"
        aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        id="theleaders-what-explains-the-steep-drop-in-reports-of-break-ins-and-thefts-in-malaysia-ref"></a>, prompting
      a need to strengthen law enforcement presence and reduce crime rates in Kuala Lumpur. This would enable residents
      to feel secure in their residences, even without the necessity of residing within gated communities or fenced-off
      neighborhoods.</p>
    <p><b>Efficient Feeder Bus Network:</b> Create a much denser network of shuttle buses that provide convenient access
      to stations. These buses should run frequently, have dedicated lanes on major roads to avoid traffic congestion,
      and have a fixed timetable that commuters can rely on. Once the enhanced feeder bus network is established,
      consider replacing park-and-ride lots at the stations with affordable condos.</p>
    <p><b>Maintain Public Infrastructure:</b> Ensure consistent and efficient maintenance of public transport systems.
      Year-long interruptions, as occurred in 2023, are not acceptable. If trainsets are out of service, prioritize
      their prompt repair. This principle should also apply to pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
    <p><b>Redirect Infrastructure Funding:</b> Shift funding from building new roads to enhancing and expanding public
      transportation systems. A denser network encourages more people to switch from private vehicles,
      mitigating traffic issues.</p>
    <p><b>Optimal Station Locations:</b> Avoid repeating past mistakes in station placement for new projects like the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRT_Circle_Line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MRT Circle
        Line</a>. Prioritize stations at locations where people live and work to achieve the primary goal of reducing
      traffic congestion.</p>
    <p><b>Enforcement:</b> Kuala Lumpur City Hall needs to strictly enforce traffic rules. Key recommendations include:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Pedestrian and Bicycle Lane Offenses:</b> Promptly tow vehicles parked on bike lanes and pedestrian
        walkways and remove unauthorized food stalls, prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety.</li>
      <li><b>Bus Lane Violations:</b> Introduce fines for regular vehicles using bus lanes.</li>
      <li><b>Ensure Fine Payment:</b> Discontinue the practice of discounts on parking tickets<a
          href="#star-up-to-60-pct-discount-on-traffic-summonses" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
          id="star-up-to-60-pct-discount-on-traffic-summonses-ref"></a> and increase monitoring of
        on-time payment of fines to promote accountability.</li>
      <li><b>Legal Consequences:</b> Consider aligning with international standards where non-payment of traffic
        violation
        tickets may result in legal actions, including the possibility of imprisonment for chronic offenders.</li>
    </ol>

    </figure>
    <p><b>Discourage Driving:</b> Increase the cost of driving through measures such as city congestion charges and
      phasing out petrol subsidies to encourage alternative transportation modes.</p>
    <p><b>Political Commitment:</b> Support leaders who understand the importance of shifting the city's focus from
      car-centric to public transport and bicycle-centric systems. Take inspiration from successful leaders like Paris'
      mayor, Anne Hidalgo.<a href="#roadcc-centre-of-paris-to-become-a-huge-low-traffic-neighbourhood"
        aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        id="roadcc-centre-of-paris-to-become-a-huge-low-traffic-neighbourhood-ref"></a></p>
    <p><b>Learn from Success:</b> Examine and draw inspiration from cities that have successfully implemented a modern
      multi-modal urban transport system, e.g. Copenhagen, Singapore or Amsterdam.</p>

    <h1>5 Assessment and specific recommendations for Putrajaya Line</h1>
    <p>Many of the challenges described above can be illustrated by the example of the Putrajaya Line. It is also
      evident that oftentimes a comparatively small investment in pedestrian infrastructure can lead to a relatively
      large increase in ridership.</p>
