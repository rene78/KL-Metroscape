    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This article aims to investigate the factors contributing to the underwhelming ridership of Kuala Lumpur's Mass
      Rapid Transport (MRT) system. The primary issues identified include insufficient first/last-mile connectivity
      and a notable absence of infrastructure supporting pedestrian and human-powered modes of transportation. In this
      context, the article not only presents overarching concepts for improving the public transportation system, but
      also provides specific and cost-effective recommendations for the MRT Putrajaya Line that could lead to a
      significant increase in ridership.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In 2010 it was decided by the Malaysian government to implement a state-of-the-art Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) for
      Kuala Lumpur to achieve the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Efficient Mobility:</b> Provide fast and efficient transportation, reducing the ever worsening traffic
        congestion problem in Klang Valley.</li>
      <li><b>Reduced Dependency on Cars:</b> Encourage a shift from private car usage, saving energy and reducing
        reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
      <li><b>Environmental Sustainability:</b> Promote eco-friendly transportation, reducing air pollution and
        greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
      <li><b>Economic Growth:</b> Attract investments, stimulate economic activity, and enhance property values along
        their routes.</li>
      <li><b>Increased inclusion:</b> Give more freedom to individuals with limited physical capabilities or financial
        resources.</li>
      <li><b>Quality of Life:</b> Improves overall quality of life by reducing stress, noise, congestion and pollution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As of 2023, two lines - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajang_line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Kajang Line</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya_line"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrajaya Line</a> - have been successfully constructed at a total
      cost of RM78 billion.<a href="#wiki-mrt1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt1-ref"></a><a
        href="#wiki-mrt2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt2-ref"></a>
      Furthermore, a third line - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRT_Circle_Line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle Line</a> - is currently in its planning phase with an additional investment of
      about <a href="#nst-mrt3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nst-mrt3-ref">RM45 billion.</a> This train network
      is considered the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in Malaysia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users of the new MRT system would unanimously attest to the world-class quality of its stations and trains, which
      easily rival those in cities like Seoul and Singapore. Moreover, care was taken to ensure that ticket prices are
      affordable for everyone. However, despite these favorable aspects, ridership falls considerably short of initial
      expectations. For instance, the Kajang line was originally projected to serve approximately <a
        href="#nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        id="nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer-ref">400,000 daily commuters.</a> Yet, since
      its inauguration in 2017, actual ridership has plateaued at roughly half of that figure.<a
        href="#myrapid-ridership-numbers" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="myrapid-ridership-numbers-ref"></a>
      Meanwhile, the average road user in Kuala Lumpur spends 75 hours each year stuck in traffic congestion.<a
        href="#tom-tom-trafic-index" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="tom-tom-trafic-index-ref"></a>
    </p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
      <p><em>"I spend about 1½ hours driving [my kids] to school and then another one to 1½ hours to drive back home. I
          feel like I am spending almost half my life in the car."</em></p>

    </blockquote>

    So why haven't Kuala Lumpur residents embraced the opulent and expensive new MRT lines, instead insisting on
    their private vehicles?
    </p>

    <h2>Reasons for low ridership</h2>
    The reasons can be boiled down in the following picture. <span style="color: red;">Add a collage of pictures. One of
      a station along a highway, bad pedestrian walkway, blocked bus lane, full park and ride parking. Possibly better alternative: Pic
      for each point.</span>
    <h3>Location of stations</h3>
    <p>In order to save money many MRT stations are inconveniently located along main roads/highways or in undeveloped
      areas instead of where
      people actually live/work. </p>

    <h3>First and last mile connectivity</h3>
    Why is it so bad?
    <ul>
      <li>Because of the point above. The stations are badly located. You cannot simply walk or cycle there.</li>
      <li>Feeder buses are unreliable, get stuck in traffic and have a low frequency.</li>
      <li>A general lack of pedestrian infrastructure. Nobody wants to walk to the station if it is unpleasant and
        dangerous.</li>
      <li>Often no direct roads to reach a station. More and more gated communities inhibit a direct access on foot or
        by bicycle to the station. <span style="color: red;">Picture of reach analysis.</span></li>
      <li>Car-dependent transit: Commuters who need to use the car to reach the MRT stations overflowing "Park and Ride"
        lots will rather drive all the way to their destination.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General recommendations</h3>
    <p>Mistakes shouldn't be repeated for future projects like the Circle Line. </p>
    <h3>Assessment and specific recommendations for Putrajaya Line</h3>
    <p>blabla</p>
