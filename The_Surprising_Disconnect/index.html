    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>This article aims to investigate the factors contributing to the underwhelming ridership of Kuala Lumpur's Mass
      Rapid Transport (MRT) system. The primary issues identified include insufficient first/last-mile connectivity and
      a notable absence of infrastructure supporting pedestrian and human-powered modes of transportation. In this
      context, the article not only presents overarching concepts for improving the public transportation system, but
      also provides specific and cost-effective recommendations for the MRT Putrajaya Line that could lead to a
      significant increase in ridership.</p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>In 2010 it was decided by the Malaysian government to implement a state-of-the-art Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) for
      Kuala Lumpur to achieve the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Efficient Mobility:</b> Provide fast and efficient transportation, reducing the ever worsening traffic
        congestion problem in Klang Valley.</li>
      <li><b>Reduced Dependency on Cars:</b> Encourage a shift from private car usage, saving energy and reducing
        reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
      <li><b>Environmental Sustainability:</b> Promote eco-friendly transportation, reducing air pollution and
        greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
      <li><b>Economic Growth:</b> Attract investments, stimulate economic activity, and enhance property values along
        their routes.</li>
      <li><b>Increased inclusion:</b> Give more freedom to individuals with limited physical capabilities or financial
        resources.</li>
      <li><b>Quality of Life:</b> Improves overall quality of life by reducing stress, noise, congestion and pollution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As of 2023, two lines - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajang_line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Kajang Line</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya_line"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putrajaya Line</a> - have been successfully constructed at a total
      cost of RM78 billion.<a href="#wiki-mrt1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt1-ref"></a><a
        href="#wiki-mrt2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wiki-mrt2-ref"></a>
      Furthermore, a third line - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRT_Circle_Line" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle Line</a> - is currently in its planning phase with an additional investment of
      about <a href="#nst-mrt3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="nst-mrt3-ref">RM45 billion.</a> This train network
      is considered the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in Malaysia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users of the new MRT system would unanimously attest to the world-class quality of its stations and trains, which
      easily rival those in cities like Seoul and Singapore. Moreover, care was taken to ensure that ticket prices are
      affordable for everyone. However, despite these favorable aspects, ridership falls considerably short of initial
      expectations. For instance, the Kajang line was originally projected to serve approximately <a
        href="#nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        id="nst-mrt-line-a-game-changer-ref">400,000 daily commuters.</a> Yet, since
      its inauguration in 2017, actual ridership has plateaued at roughly half of that figure.<a
        href="#myrapid-ridership-numbers" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="myrapid-ridership-numbers-ref"></a>
      Meanwhile, the average road user in Kuala Lumpur spends 75 hours each year stuck in traffic congestion.<a

    So why haven't Kuala Lumpur residents embraced the opulent and expensive new MRT lines, preferring instead to
    continue using their private vehicles?

    <h1>Why Ridership Remains Low</h1>
    <p>In essence, there are three straightforward explanations for why numerous individuals opt to brave the daily
      traffic-congested journey to work in their personal vehicles:</p>
    <h2>1 Insufficient Network Density</h2>
    <p>Commuters seek convenience and proximity to their destinations. Addressing this fundamental challenge demands
      dedicated politicians who recognize the vital role of public transportation and prioritize its expansion.</p>
    <h2>2 Inaccessible Stations</h2>
    <p>This issue runs deeper and warrants further exploration: What factors contribute to the station's
      inaccessibility?</p>
    <h3>Unfavourable Station Locations</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>During the construction phase, cost-saving measures like the avoidance of extensive tunneling work often led to
      the placement of MRT stations along highways or in underdeveloped areas rather than in locations where people live
      and work. This has resulted in disappointingly low population density around the stations. Unfortunately, valuable
      land adjacent to the MRT stations is frequently underutilized, occupied by:</p>

    <p>Similar to numerous other young cities in Asia and North America, Kuala Lumpur has largely structured its urban
      development around automobile-centric infrastructure. This emphasis on car-centric planning has led to an
      ever increasing amount of highways that crisscross and dissect established neighborhoods within the city.
      Unsurprisingly, the pervasive road networks and expressways have emerged as the principal hurdles confronting
      daily commuters on their journey to reach the nearest train station. What is increasingly prevalent is the
      disheartening reality that apartment complexes, housing thousands of potential users of the Mass Rapid Transit
      (MRT) system, find themselves isolated by seemingly insurmountable highways, creating a stark physical and
      psychological divide between residents and the public transportation network.

    </figure>
    <p>Gated communities and cordoned-off residential areas further worsen the accessibility of public transport stops.
      These closed-off places force pedestrians and cyclists to take a diversion on their way to the station - often
      along a busy road. In addition, gated communities frequently prevent cars from using the direct route to their
      destination. The private roads of the gated communities force the drivers to divert onto main roads, which further
      deteriorate the overall traffic situation.</p>
    <h3>Neglected Pedestrian Infrastructure</h3>
    <figure class="figure-float-right">

    </figure>
    <p>In Kuala Lumpur, the condition of pedestrian infrastructure leaves much to be desired, ranging from subpar to
      completely absent in some areas. This unfortunate reality places the lives of those who venture to walk to public
      transport stations at considerable risk. Navigating the city's streets on foot can be a perilous endeavor, with
      inadequate sidewalks, poorly marked crosswalks, and a lack of pedestrian-friendly amenities making the journey
      treacherous. Many drivers also assume that pedestrians will wait until they have driven by - even at zebra
      crossings
      and green pedestrian lights. As a result, many residents opt for the perceived safety and convenience of their own
      cars when commuting, further exacerbating the city's traffic congestion and environmental challenges.</p>
    <h3>Vehicle-dependent public transport</h3>
    <p>Public transit, while a promising solution for urban mobility, faces significant challenges in areas with low
      population density around its stations. Kuala Lumpur's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system is no exception, as it
      often requires commuters to rely on private vehicles, e-hailing services like Grab, or feeder buses to access the
      stations. However, each of these options presents its unique set of challenges.</p>
    <figure class="figure-float-right">
      <a href="./data/full_park_and_ride_lot_high_res.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

      <figcaption>Cars have to park on the street in front of the park-and-ride of Cyberjaya Utara MRT station. -
        Source: Own work</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p> Private Vehicle Dilemma: Many commuters choose to use their private vehicles for the entire journey to their
      destinations rather than navigating the traffic to reach the MRT station and the
      added challenge of finding a parking spot at the often overflowing park-and-ride (P&R) facility.</p>
    <p> E-hailing Quandary: E-hailing services like Grab offer an alternative way to reach MRT stations. However, this
      convenience comes at a cost that can offset the economic advantages of using public transport. Affordability
      remains a key issue for many commuters, especially in areas where public transit is intended to provide a more
      economical mode of transportation.</p>
    <figure class="figure-float-right">
      <img src="./data/feeder_busses_tweet.jpg" alt="It is hard to trust the feeder busses">
      <figcaption>Feeder busses have their very own sets of challenges. - Source: <a

          rel="noopener noreferrer">@NabilErsyad</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p> Feeder Bus Challenges: The feeder bus system, a crucial link between residential areas and MRT stations, faces a
      number of issues of its own. In its current form, the coverage area of feeder buses is often limited, leaving many
      potential passengers without convenient access. Moreover, the overall number of feeder buses is insufficient,
      leading to discomfort for those who do use them. These buses are frequently plagued by
      unreliability, making it difficult for passengers to plan their journeys with confidence. They often become
      ensnared in the same traffic jams that plague private vehicles, leading to unpredictable schedules and longer
      travel times. The low frequency of feeder bus services further compounds the problem, as passengers often must
      wait for extended periods without a reliable timetable to guide their travels.</p>
    <h2>3 Problems with reliability and maintenance</h2>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Reliability issues. Sometimes major problems, e.g. LRT line out of service for 1 year;
        Reduced amount of coaches lead to long waiting times in between departures, etc. (Twitter post about LRT
        breakdown? or <a href="https://x.com/NabilErsyad/status/1679830914602512384?s=20)">this one from nabil</a> .
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Stations are huge. Once the station is reached it can take a long time to <a
          href="https://x.com/NabilErsyad/status/1670093593636372481?s=20">walk all the way to the platform</a> </span>

    <p>This geographical separation not only compounds the difficulties faced by commuters but also underscores the
      pressing need for comprehensive urban planning that prioritizes accessibility and sustainable modes of
      transportation, thereby mitigating the automobile-centric constraints that continue to hinder Kuala Lumpur's
      transportation landscape.</p>
